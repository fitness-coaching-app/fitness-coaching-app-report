Furthermore, thanks to the COVID-19 situation, people may find themself unable to go to the gym, and the cost of the gym is expensive for some people.

This project aims to solve the problems by creating a fitness application that can guide users to exercise correctly and properly using their phone's front-facing camera. Additionally, it can help encourage users to exercise by creating a set of features to make users' exercise experience more enjoyable. This application will make exercise easier for everyone and cost less than going to the gym.
