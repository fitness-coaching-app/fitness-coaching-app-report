      abstract = {Fitness exercises are very beneficial to personal health and fitness; however, they can also be ineffective and potentially dangerous if performed incorrectly by the user. Exercise mistakes are made when the user does not use the proper form, or pose. In our work, we introduce Pose Trainer, an application that detects the user's exercise pose and provides personalized, detailed recommendations on how the user can improve their form. Pose Trainer uses the state of the art in pose estimation to detect a user's pose, then evaluates the vector geometry of the pose through an exercise to provide useful feedback. We record a dataset of over 100 exercise videos of correct and incorrect form, based on personal training guidelines, and build geometric-heuristic and machine learning algorithms for evaluation. Pose Trainer works on four common exercises and supports any Windows or Linux computer with a GPU.},

      doi = {10.1109/TENCONSpring.2017.8070063},
      abstract = {With the advancement of technology, everyday life is becoming convenient day by day. However, on the other side, people suffering from various fitness related problems such as obesity, survical and muscular pains due to lack of physical exercise and availability of trainers. In this paper, we propose a virtual trainer with real-time feedback and the assessment score to different exercise postures using Kinect sensor. Recognition of the exercise has been performed using Random Forest (RF) classifier. The classified gestures provide the actual 3D view of the posture on the screen with a matching score such that the user can correct his/her posture by utilizing the feedback. Data of 9 basic exercise postures have been collected from 10 individuals. The performance of the system has been evaluated in user-independent training mode with an average accuracy of 96\%. The whole system facilitates individuals an interactive exercise system and a novel contribution to the Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) research domain.},
